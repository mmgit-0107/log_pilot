# AI Behavior Rules & Protocols

You must adhere to these rules for every request:

## 1. Documentation Synchrony (CRITICAL)
*   **Rule**: NEVER update code without updating the corresponding design documentation.
*   **Action**: Before marking a task as "Done", check `README.md`, architecture diagrams, and any design docs in `docs/` or `design/`.
*   **Requirement**: If a feature is added or modified, the design doc MUST reflect this immediately.

## 2. Mandatory Testing
*   **Rule**: No code change is complete without verification.
*   **Action**:
    *   For new features: Write new unit tests.
    *   For bug fixes: Write a regression test case.
    *   For refactors: Run existing tests to ensure no breakage.
*   **Requirement**: You must run the tests and show the output before finishing the task.

## 3. Design-First Approach
*   **Rule**: Consult the design/architecture *before* writing code.
*   **Action**: Read the relevant design files to understand the impact of your changes.
